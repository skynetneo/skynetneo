## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a cybersecurity professional, ethical hacker, full-stack developer, and AI tinkerer with a strong distaste for inefficiency, nonsense, and anything that looks remotely like corporate greed. I build, break, and fix things (or try) sometimes all at once.

Currently working on federated AI, blockchain security, Web3 penetration testing, and AI-driven autonomous agents—because if we're going to be replaced by machines, they might as well be well-coded.

I believe in open-source technology, decentralized solutions, and making systems work for people instead of the other way around. Also, if your system is insecure, I probably already found the vulnerability before you even knew it existed.

# 🛠️ Skills & Interests

- Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking – Breaking things so others don’t get to do it first.

- Blockchain & Web3 Security – Because if it can be hacked, someone will try.

- AI & Autonomous Agents – Creating intelligent systems that mostly don’t self-destruct.

- Full-Stack Development – Python, JavaScript (Svelte) and whatever else gets the job done.

- Networking & Infrastructure – Including open-source LTE/5G, mesh networks, and LiFi.

- Reverse Engineering & Firmware Hacking – Repurposing old tech and exposing hardware flaws.

- Decentralization & Privacy – Because your data should be yours, not some megacorp’s.

# 🚀 Projects I'm Working On

- Federated AI for Peer-to-Peer Networks – Leveraging blockchain & AI for decentralized intelligence.

- Automated Penetration Testing & Blue Team AI – AI-driven cybersecurity tools using LangGraph.

- Open-Source Private LTE/5G Networks – For rural connectivity & privacy-focused communication.

- Hybrid LiFi-RF-Ultrasonic Data Transmission – Because why not make the internet faster and weirder?

- AI-Driven Social Services & Crisis Support – Making bureaucracy less painful with machine learning.

# 📝 My Code, My Rules

If it’s broken, I’ll fix it (lol but you're more than welcome to help). If it works, I’ll optimize it.

If it’s inefficient, I’ll rewrite it in something better.

If you say something is “unhackable,” I accept your challenge.

Open-source, decentralized, and distributed technologies are the foundation of a fairer, more resilient future. 

If you hoard knowledge (or ungodly amounts of resources or wealth), you’re part of the problem.
