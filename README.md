# About Me

I am an ethical hacker, full-stack developer, and AI tinkerer with a strong distaste for inefficiency, nonsense, and anything that looks remotely like corporate greed. I build, break, and fix things (or try) sometimes all at once.

Currently working on federated AI, blockchain security, Web3 penetration testing, and AI-driven autonomous agents—because if we're going to be replaced by machines, they might as well be well-coded.

I believe in open-source technology, decentralized solutions, and making systems work for people instead of the other way around.
## Skills & Interests

- Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking – Breaking things so others don’t get to do it first.

- Blockchain & Web3 Security – Because if it can be hacked, someone will try.

- AI & Autonomous Agents – Creating intelligent systems that mostly don’t self-destruct.

- Full-Stack Development – Python, JavaScript (Svelte) and whatever else gets the job done.

- Networking & Infrastructure – Including open-source LTE/5G, mesh networks, and LiFi.

- Reverse Engineering & Firmware Hacking – Repurposing old tech and exposing hardware flaws.

- Decentralization & Privacy – Because your data should be yours, not some megacorp’s.

Open-source, decentralized, and distributed technologies are the foundation of a fairer, more resilient future. 

If you hoard knowledge (or ungodly amounts of resources or wealth), you’re part of the problem.
